# i2cPanTilt
go program to test controlling the Pimoroni PanTilt (Raspberry Pi) Hat using i2c via periph

Routines will be incorporated in my mangolink reply.go so I can control the PanTilt with a gui program (Work in Progress).
This program is stand alone so it will demonstrate control of the servos.

i2cDelta does an incremental move. Up, Down, left, Right work in 5 degree "jumps".
